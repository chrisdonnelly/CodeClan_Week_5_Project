# Simple_Web_App_Using_Ruby_and_Sinatra

This personal project involved creating a web app using RESTful routes to display, receive and store user inputs in a relational database.  I was responsible for evert stage of the development cycle.  
 
The design stages included requirements gathering, user journey maps, wireframes, MoSCoW analysis and project management via Trello. 

The app was written in Ruby using the Sinatra DSL.

I employed RESTful routes within a MVC structure with a focus on single responsibility. 

Data was persisted via PostGres in a SQL relational database.  

The app provides a league management tool for a competative card game, but could be adapted to administrate leagues for any competative game or sport.
