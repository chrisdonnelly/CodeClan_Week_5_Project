# Simple_Web_App_Using_Ruby_and_Sinatra

This personal project involved creating a web app to display, receive and store user inputs in a database.  I was responsible for every stage of the development cycle.  
 
The design stages included requirements gathering, user journey maps, wireframes, MoSCoW analysis and project management via Trello. 

The app was written in Ruby using the Sinatra DSL.

I employed RESTful routes within a MVC pattern with a focus on SOLID principles.

Data was persisted to a PostGreSQL relational database.  

The app provides a league management tool for a competative card game, but could be adapted to administrate leagues for any competative game or sport.
